        <ul><li><h5>Firstly, we will feel sad! :( Before we let you go, we ensure that all your previous plans are saved in our databases. You will be able to retrieve your old plans after you reinstall the App with the same mobile number. We will not be able to retrieve your Chat, as the Chat is stored on Clients' systems only and not at our servers.</h5></li></ul>
            
        <h4><b>Should I install the App to be part of a plan?</b></h4>
            <ul><li><h5><b>No.</b> If you are invited to any plan by your friend - via SMS, you will be prompted to install the App or open the plan in a browser. If you open the plan in a browser you can see all the plan details and will be able to select your preference by voting.</h5></li>
        <li><h5>However, you will not receive any notifications/updates by opening it in a browser. You have to revist the URL or refresh the page to view any update. Also, opening the plan in a browser will allow you to only vote, you will not be able to Chat or Add friends or Add a new choice or Buzz or save the plan. We always suggest you to install the App - it's Handy, if you love to go out with friends!</h5></li></ul>

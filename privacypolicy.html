        <h2><br>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h5><i>Last updated on July 7th, 2016</i></h5>
        
        <br>
        <h5>Fouramis Techonologies Pvt. Ltd. ("WhatsDplan") provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using WhatsDplan App. If you do not agree to our practices, please do not use WhatsDplan App.<br><br>
            This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the WhatsDplan Terms of Service. Your use of the WhatsDplan App and any personal information you provide on the WhatsDplan App remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.</h5>
        <br>
        <h4><b>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</b></h4>
            <h5>This Privacy Policy is part of WhatsDplan’s Terms of Service and covers the treatment of user information, including personally identifying information, obtained by WhatsDplan, including information obtained when you access the WhatsDplan’s Site, use the WhatsDplan Service or any other software provided by WhatsDplan.
            <br><br>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that WhatsDplan does not own or control, or to individuals whom WhatsDplan does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which WhatsDplan may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</h5>
            <br>
        <h4><b>The Information WhatsDplan Collects</b></h4>
            <h5>WhatsDplan may obtain the following types of information from or concerning you or your mobile phone device, which may include information that can be used to identify you as specified below (“Personally Identifying Information”):
            <br>
            <u>User Provided Information:</u> You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your mobile phone number, user name (if applicable) and mobile device information to WhatsDplan when choosing to participate in various uses of the WhatsDplan App, such as registering as a user. In order to provide the our Service, WhatsDplan will periodically access your address book or contact list on your mobile phone to locate the mobile phone numbers of other WhatsDplan users (“in-network” numbers), or otherwise categorize other mobile phone numbers as “out-network” numbers, which are stored as one-way irreversibly hashed values.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4><b>The Information WhatsDplan Does Not Collect</b></h4>
            <h5>WhatsDplan does not collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users’ mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers—the WhatsDplan mobile application will associate whatever name the WhatsDplan user has assigned to the mobile telephone number in his/her mobile address book or contact list — and this occurs dynamically on the mobile device itself and not on WhatsDplan’s servers and is not transmitted to WhatsDplan. This means that if you have your friend’s mobile phone number associated with the name “Shakespeare” in your mobile address book, that’s the name that will appear for that mobile phone number in your WhatsDplan contact list. We do not collect location data, unless the user voluntarily does so.
            <br><br>
            The contents of messages that have been delivered by the WhatsDplan App are not copied, kept or archived by WhatsDplan in the normal course of business. Users type their messages, which are sent via data service to our servers, and routed to the intended recipient. Once a message has been delivered, it no longer resides on our servers. The contents of any delivered messages are not kept or retained by WhatsDplan — the only records of the content of any delivered messages reside directly on the sender’s and recipient’s mobile devices. The Plans created by a user on WhatsDplan App reside in the servers, the user’s mobile phone and the recipient’s mobile phone until they are deleted by the users. Our server holds the Plans and Plan related information until all the associated or involved users of that Plan delete it from the App. The Plan related information will be deleted from our servers after all the users are no longer part of the Plan.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4><b>The Way WhatsDplan Uses Information</b></h4>
            <h5>If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the WhatsDplan App, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the WhatsDplan App. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of the WhatsDplan App and will be retained. Your name (as it is saved in other user's mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users and other users may contact you through the WhatsDplan App. Your mobile number may become part of other user’s contact list if you are involved in one or more Plans with that user. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major WhatsDplan App changes).
            <br><br>
            We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during ticket bookings or other in-App activities only; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4><b>When WhatsDplan Discloses Information</b></h4>
            <h5>We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the WhatsDplan Service. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the WhatsDplan App. We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and central laws or where in our reasonable belief, an individual’s physical safety may be at risk or threatened. WhatsDplan also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that WhatsDplan believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the WhatsDplan App or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of WhatsDplan, our users or others.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Your Choices</b></h4>
            <h5>You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the WhatsDplan App, in which case WhatsDplan may not be able to provide any service to you. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, please delete your account, uninstall the WhatsDplan mobile application and discontinue use of the WhatsDplan Service; your continued usage of the WhatsDplan Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as SMS authentication in certain cases) to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and granting you access to the WhatsDplan Service. Please contact WhatsDplan via email to contactus@WhatsDplan.com or available web forms with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or any other choices.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b></h4>
            <h5>WhatsDplan uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to WhatsDplan and you do so at your own risk. Using unsecured wifi or other unprotected networks to submit messages through the WhatsDplan App is never recommended. Once we receive your transmission of information, WhatsDplan makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If WhatsDplan learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. WhatsDplan may post a notice on the WhatsDplan Site or through the WhatsDplan App if a security breach occurs.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</b></h4>
            <h5>All the third party or partners links available on our App are mutually agreed by us and you clicking on any of them is at your own will and interest. When you enter any third party website from our App, you agree to their Terms of Service and WhatsDplan is not liable to any consequences thereafter.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4><b>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</b></h4>
            <h5>In the event that WhatsDplan is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the (hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</b></h4>
            <h5>This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the WhatsDplan Site and WhatsDplan App constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any amendments.</h5>
